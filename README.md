# Skwap
**Skwap** is an online social sharing platform for people who want to connect in the *London* area and learn some **new skills** for *free*. It was inspired by other online platforms such as **Fiverr** and **Depop**. It was built in **Ruby on Rails** in only 5 days.

# How it works
The site works on a *credits* basis, allowing users to recieve an initial credit upon first joining the site in which they can connect with another user locally and arrange a free meetup. Upon completition, the user is *deducted* a credit and the teacher is *rewarded* one for sharing a skill. In this way users are encouraged to **give back to the community** in order to earn more credits to continue their free learning in **whichever** area they would like. A hosted version of **Skwap** can be found [**here**](http://skwap.herokuapp.com/).

# Requirements 
1. Create a fully functioning multi-page website built in Rails
2. The website must utilise multiple models
3. Ensure it has secure register and login capabilities

# How it was built
Skwap was built in **Ruby on Rails**, using **HTML** and **CSS** along with a little bit of **JavaScript**. I also utilised the following libraries:
- [**Foundation**](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
- [**jQuery**](https://jquery.com/download/)
- [**Animate.css**](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)
- [**Typed.js**](http://www.mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/)

# Planning
I first created a **Trello** board for the project in order to properly manage the flow of tasks that I would need to tackle to achieve my project goal. This was referred to throughout to break down the size of my tasks.

Next I began with my first Trello task, planning out how the user would experience and interact with the site. This mainly took place with **wireframes** created on *Balsamiq*, but I also planned some of the pages out using paper wireframes too.
