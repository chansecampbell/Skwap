# Skwap
**Skwap** is an online social sharing platform for people who want to connect in the *London* area and learn some **new skills** for *free*. It was inspired by other online platforms such as **Fiverr** and **Depop**.

# How it works
The site works on a *credits* basis, allowing users to recieve an initial credit upon first joining the site in which they can connect with another user locally and arrange a free meetup. Upon completition, the user is *deducted* a credit and the teacher is *rewarded* one for sharing a skill. In this way users are encouraged to **give back to the community** in order to earn more credits to continue their free learning in **whichever** area they would like. A hosted version of **Skwap** can be found [**here**](http://skwap.herokuapp.com/).
